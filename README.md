# Happy Birthday Jeff!


This is my little Commodore 64 demo for my friend Jeff's Birthday on April 18th 2020.

It has been written in assembly language using the [ACME Macro Assembler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/).



## Building

### Building on Linux

I have built this under Linux. It should be a similar process to build under MacOS or maybe even Windows with a few tweaks.

A `makefile` is included, running `make` should produce a usable `hbjf2020.d64` file in the `obj` subfolder.

In addition to `make` you will need the following tools:

[ACME Macro Assembler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/)
[VICE C64 Emulator](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/)

ACME is the cross assembler used, it will produce a `.prg` file. The `makefile` uses `c1541` from the VICE package and builds the `.d64` from that `.prg`.

### Running your own build on Linux

The `./run` script will build the program and start it using the VICE emulator.

## Components

### Background

Background has been created in GIMP with this [Judas Priest](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/judas-priest-font/) font. 

The included `.xcf` from GIMP has been exported to a `.png` file. The 64 code is generated by [image2c64](https://pypi.org/project/c64img/) :

```
image2c64 -f hires --raw ./background.png
```

That will give us two files, a monochrome bitmap in `background_bitmap.raw` and a color map in `background_screen.raw` which we will include in our code.

### Sprites

The sprites have been created with [Spritemate](https://www.spritemate.com/), a neat online app.

Sprites were saved in `mysprites.spm` and Spritemate also exported a `sprites.a` that is immediately usable in our code.
